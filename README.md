# Qt-Designer-pyuic-to-py

Are you tired of changing your code from pyuic4.bat to add the QMainWindow as the parent class for the Window class?
If so, then this is the perfect thing for you!

Just copy the pyuic to py.py file to thr source folder and run it! You'll get a converted.py file which will have converted everything for you! Isnt that great?!

For a demo, try running the program with the default files and check the results. You can modify the program according to your needs as it is mostly just string.replace ;)
